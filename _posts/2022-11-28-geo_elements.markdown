The osculating elements of ring particles can vary significantly. We propose a new set of elements to replace them.

## Orbital Elements
<p>
This post will discuss the orbits of tiny particles (e.g., particles within planetary rings) about a massive oblate body (e.g., Saturn).
This particle-planet system is a perturbed variation of the standard two-body problem in which two particles orbit each other. In this latter problem, the particles trace static ellipses with a common focus at their center of mass, and given either particle's position <strong>r</strong> and velocity <strong>v</strong> at any one time we may determine them for all times, i.e., determine the particle's orbit. In general, <strong>r</strong> and <strong>v</strong> are three-dimensional vectors, but for simplicity, we will consider only two dimensions here. Thus, we require four quantities &mdash; the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> components of both <strong>r</strong> and <strong>v</strong> &mdash; for orbit determination. Astronomers typically transform these four quantities into other quantities more convenient for orbit descriptions: the semimajor axis <em>a</em> and eccentricity <em>e</em> of the traced ellipse, the angle <em>&varpi;</em> that the ellipse's major axis makes to some reference direction, and the angle <em>&nu;</em> that the particle itself makes to the major axis. These latter two angles are called the longitude of pericenter and true anomaly, respectively, and all four taken together are called the "orbital elements." <a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>

<p id="footnote-1">[1] The careful reader may note that I promised four constants but included the variable <em>&nu;</em>. Have I swindled you? No. One may swap <em>&nu;</em> with the "time of pericenter passage," which is indeed constant but not usually useful.</p>
