The osculating elements of ring particles can vary significantly. We propose a new set of elements to replace them.

## Orbital Elements

This post will discuss how to describe orbits of tiny particles (e.g., particles within planetary rings) about a massive oblate body (e.g., Saturn).
This particle-planet system is a perturbed variation of the standard two-body problem in which two particles orbit each other. In this latter problem, the particles move along static ellipses with a common focus at their center of mass, and given <strong>r<\strong> and <v> at any one time we may determine them for all times, i.e., determine the particle orbits. In general, <b>r and <v> are 3D vectors, but for simplicity, we will consider only two dimensions here. Thus, we require four quantities -- the <i>x and <i>y components of both <b>r and <v> -- for orbit determination. Astronomers typically transform these four quantities into other quantities more convenient for orbit descriptions: the semimajor axis <i>a and eccentricity <e> of the traced ellipse, the angle &varpi; that the ellipse's major axis makes to some reference direction, and the angle &nu; that the particle itself makes to the major axis.
