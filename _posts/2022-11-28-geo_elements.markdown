The osculating elements of ring particles can vary significantly. We propose a new set of elements to replace them.

## Orbital Elements

This post will discuss how to describe orbits of tiny particles (e.g., particles within planetary rings) about a massive oblate body (e.g., Saturn).
This particle-planet system is a perturbed variation of the standard two-body problem in which two particles orbit each other. In this latter problem, the particles move along static ellipses with a common focus at their center of mass, and given position <strong>r</strong> and velocity <strong>v</strong> at any one time we may determine them for all times, i.e., determine the particle orbits. In general, <strong>r</strong> and <strong>v</strong> are three-dimensional vectors, but for simplicity, we will consider only two dimensions here. Thus, we require four quantities &mdash; the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> components of both <strong>r</strong> and <strong>v</strong> &mdash; for orbit determination. Astronomers typically transform these four quantities into other quantities more convenient for orbit descriptions: the semimajor axis <em>a</em> and eccentricity <em>e</em> of the traced ellipse, the angle <em>&varpi;</em> that the ellipse's major axis makes to some reference direction, and the angle <em>&nu;</em> that the particle itself makes to the major axis. These latter two angles are called the longitude of pericenter and true anomaly, respectively.
