  Orbital Dynamicist, Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer
</p>
  I received my PhD at the University of MD, College Park in 2020 while studying <a href="https://drum.lib.umd.edu/handle/1903/26851">
	Resonances in Ring, Satellite, and Planetary Systems </a>. Since then, I have worked as a postdoc at NASA GSFC on the Juno Magnetometer
	Science team and, as of April 2022, as a machine learning engineer at United States Pharmacoepia building a model to predict drug
	shortages.
